## Logger module

This is a Python 3.x module which aims to replace the built-in `print` function.
This seeks to be as modular as possible, to be able to re-use in various
projects without the need to change a lot of things, or anything at all.
With the current state of this project not everything can be covered.
However, this *will* eventually cover every use case.

This does not seek, however, to replace the standard library's logging module.
Both the logging package and the preset module have different aims.

This is made and maintained by Vgr.
