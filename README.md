# Logger module

This is a general-purpose logging module, intended to be used in
software that require logging of various operations, or, more
importantly, for software that want to implement internationalization
(i18n) or localization (l10n). Full documentation can be viewed in the
module itself. This module is pretty much complete as-is, short of
some testing. If someone does come up with a feature request however,
I'll be glad to work on it. Pull requests are also welcome, and so are
issues.
